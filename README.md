## About AERzip

AERzip is an open-source Python package that provides a number of useful tools to allow compression and decompression of AEDAT files. Its main advantage is the reduction in the size of the AEDAT files stored on disk without practically increasing the processing time.

## Installing

You can install AERzip via pip thanks to its [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/AERzip/) distribution:

```
pip install AERzip
```

## Documentation

The [ReadTheDocs Documentation](https://aerzip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides a lot of useful information about the AERzip functions. Part of this documentation can be found inside the own code, which has been documented using docstrings.
