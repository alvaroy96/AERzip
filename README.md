## About AERzip

AERzip is an open-source Python package which provides a good number of useful tools to allow **AEDAT files compression and decompression**. Its main advantage is decreasing the size of the stored in disk AEDAT files with virtually no increase in processing time, so it could be considered a real-time task.

## Installing

You can install AERzip via pip thanks to its [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/AERzip/) distribution:

```
pip install AERzip
```

## Documentation

The ReadTheDocs Documentation provides a lot of useful information about the AERzip functions. Part of this documentation can be found inside the own code, which has been documented using docstrings.
